# ðŸ“š CPP Modules

## Introduction

This repository is part of the 42 School curriculum and introduces the C++ programming language. It focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and modern C++ features, building on the foundations of C.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into 10 modules, each targeting a specific aspect of C++ through progressively challenging exercises:

* **CPP00**: Introduction to OOP basics â€” namespaces, classes, member functions, initialization, static/const usage
* **CPP01**: Memory management â€” allocation, references, pointers to members, and control flow with switch
* **CPP02**: Ad-hoc polymorphism â€” operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical Form
* **CPP03**: Inheritance â€” class hierarchies and behavior reuse
* **CPP04**: Subtype polymorphism â€” abstract classes and interfaces
* **CPP05**: Exceptions â€” error handling and program robustness
* **CPP06**: Type casting â€” safe and explicit conversions between types
* **CPP07**: Templates â€” generic programming with parameterized types
* **CPP08**: STL containers and algorithms â€” using standard templates effectively
* **CPP09**: Advanced STL â€” applying containers and algorithms to practical problems

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cmunoz-g/CPP-Modules.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a module**:

   ```bash
   cd CPP-Modules/CPP0X
   ```

   Replace `CPP0X` with the desired module number.

3. **Compile and run**:
   Each exercise provides a `Makefile`. Build with:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   Then execute the binary:

   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```
